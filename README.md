# Unique Encrypt?
<p>Unique Encrypt is a user-friendly tool designed to encrypt texts or numbers using a personalized encryption method based on a user-provided password. The tool ensures that only the user with the correct password can decrypt the encrypted text, providing an extra layer of security.</p>

<p>The user enters the desired text, and the tool encrypts the text.</p>

### 🔒 How it Works
<ol>
  <li>Input: The user enters the text they want to encrypt into the tool.</li>
  <li>Encryption Logic: The tool follows a unique encryption process, which involves the following steps:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The text is arranged in a "table" format, where each letter is shifted one line down and one column to the right, creating a diagonal view.</li>
    <li>Spaces in the text are replaced with random special characters to further obfuscate the data.</li>
    <li>The table is then transformed back into text, following the order it was in the table.</li>
    <li>The resulting text is reversed from back to front, changing its sequence.</li>
    <li>Finally, the letters in the text are converted to special characters, adding another layer of complexity to the encryption.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

### 🔎 Example
For instance, if the user enters the text <code>"Hello, World!"</code> and uses the password "example123" for encryption, the tool will produce the following encrypted output: <code>"♤∴!⑇⥾♝☀⑇⇞⇞✲✸⑇⧽⧽⧽✲✾⑇⇞⇞⇞⇞✸✲⑇⇞⇞⇞⇞⇞,♛".</code>.

# 🔓 Decryption
<p>To decrypt the text, the user must paste the encrypted text back into the tool and provide the correct password. The tool uses the same password to reverse the encryption process and recover the original text.</p>

### Unique Encryption
<p>The uniqueness of the encryption lies in the fact that each user's password creates a personalized encryption logic. This means that even if two users encrypt the same text, the resulting encrypted output will be different based on their individual passwords. Therefore, even if someone gains access to the encrypted text, they won't be able to decrypt it without the correct password.</p>
